Image contrast

Consider increasing the contrast ratio between this image's foreground and background.
The image's contrast ratio is 2.39. This ratio is based on an estimated foreground color of #A0A9B0 and an estimated background color of #FFFFFF. Consider increasing this ratio to 3.00 or greater.

Touch target
com.example.vinilos:id/search_close_btn
Consider making this clickable item larger.
This item's width is 40dp. Consider making the width of this touch target 48dp or larger. A TouchDelegate has been detected on one of this item's ancestors. This message can be ignored if the delegate is of sufficient size and handles touches for this item.

Text Scaling
